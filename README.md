# ðŸ“ŠðŸš¬ Analyzing Correlations and Testing Hypotheses
Objective: Analyzed the 'smoking' dataset to explore relationships and test hypotheses regarding smoking habits and health outcomes, such as cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar,  triglycerides, among others. Examined correlations and physical activity levels to gain insights into the effects of smoking and physical inactivity on health.

## ðŸ“‘ Description
In this project, I performed a statistical analysis on the 'Body Signal of Smoking' dataset to identify possible relationships, correlations, and test hypotheses regarding health indicators, and to relate them to healthy habits (such as exercise). I conducted exploratory analysis and data cleaning to better understand the data and obtain more efficient results in my analyses. I also designed graphs and began testing the hypotheses and correlations. This allowed me to conclude my analysis and relate it to another study on smoking habits and physical activities.
